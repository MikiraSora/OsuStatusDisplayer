# osu-database-reader
Allows for parsing/reading osu!'s database files

In the future, this will read more file formats, and likely write them too.

### Currently finished:
* reading osu!.db
* reading collection.db
* reading scores.db
* reading presence.db
* reading replays

### Planned:
* reading osu! beatmaps (maybe?)
* writing osu!.db
* writing collection.db
* writing scores.db
* writing presence.db
* writing osu! beatmaps (maybe?)

## Usage
Add to your project and include the osu_database_reader namespace.
See unit tests for more detailed usage.
